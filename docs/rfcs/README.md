# RFCs: Request For Comments

This directory holds all RFCs created for the Mozilla IAM project.
Note that unlike the traditional, well-known [RFCs](https://www.rfc-editor.org) these are actual requests for comment
that are issued inside the IAM project, discussed, modified, etc. but are abandoned when the project takes form, in
favor of the project's own documentation. RFC Editor would consider these to be `Informational` or `Experimental` -
**not** `Internet Standard`.

In other words, this does **not** adhere to <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7322.txt>.
That said, we do expect <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt> to be followed.

In other words, the documents in this directory may inform about the initial scope, intent, design of the project but is
not necessarily 100.00% accurate.
